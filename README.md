## General Info
This project is for the Iowa State University CprE 288 course taken Spring of 2021. 
This code is designed to run on an iRobot “Roomba”, with added sensors(Ping and Ir) and servo motors. Our code ran on a tm4c123gh6pm microprocessor. We also interfaced with the “Roomba’s” bump sensors and motors using the open_interface library. In this project we added bump and boundary detection to our “Roomba” and could remotely control the robot while avoiding obstacles in our path successfully into an end zone.
